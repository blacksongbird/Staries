    <span class="byline">Memories & Melodies - Gabriel Lobo</span>

      <p>An interlude is a concept that is commonly used in different art expressions —especially in music— to name a specific part, that ends and introduces a section in an artwork. In simple words, it is a division. It's the end and the beginning of something, regularly used to pull apart the first and second part of a record or playlist.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;However, I don't want to follow the rules that its concept establishes. Therefore, the middle of the outcome, both the first as the second part are the interlude of the end of our road —for now—. Let's see it as that thin and almost invisible line between the before and the after of these memories.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Clearly, interludes can cause different feelings; they leave you homesickness because of the end of an age, but they also give you hope for what's coming next. New Year, for example, is the most celebrated interlude in the world after the birthdays —another memory comes to my mind, but doesn't fit in here right now—.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Anyway, enough talking about nostalgia and hope. It's better to focus on one feeling at a time, or our head will end up anxious. And trust me, nobody wants that. This memory is the hardest of them all, because it will break our story's structure and will change everything we were used to. Forget about cheesy and romantic situations; this is real life. And reality, once again, hurts.</p>

      <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">-Middle of the Outcom (Part II)-</h1>
      <span class="byline">Touch <ion-icon name="skip-forward" style="font-size: 15px; color: #57a639"></ion-icon> to skip to the next song. </span>
      <br><br>

      <p>Back again to that instant in which the first part became a cliffhanger. I can swear that I felt that my heart stopped beating during that thousandth of a second. My brain was trying to understand what the fuck had happened, why it happened and what the hell should I do now. After some seconds, one of the thousands of thoughts that went through my head highlighted over the rest.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Then I hugged her. I told her that everything would be fine and that I wouldn't leave. That was the first time I lied to Sea. I knew that, if I wanted the relationship to grow, I had to give my best and try not to lie to her about anything. But I broke that rule because something else was at stake. She and her health were at stake. I would prefer to make her hate me than putting her at risk. Even if I could turn back time, I would've done the same that I did as soon as I saw her arms.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;She didn't cry, and neither did I —despite how much I wanted to do so—. I tried to make her believe that everything was fine, but deep inside I felt manipulated. I even thought that she knew that this would affect me the way it did, to the point I imagined she did so to keep me by her side in exchange for not hurting herself anymore. All of these things became a riot inside my head, bringing me back to reality. Because of how mentally exhausting this event was, there are a lot of details I don't remember clearly. Therefore, for those who know the full story, I'm sorry if I skipped details that were part of the events. However, regarding this memory itself, what I wrote is it entirely; it isn't incomplete because, for me, that was what was embodied in my memories —too embodied, clearly—.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;After hugging her for at least 10 more seconds, I kissed her. Finally, I told her that everything was fine —again, another lie— and went to deliver my essay with Roy.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—I need to talk with you —I said.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—What's up? Is everything back to normal with Sea? —he asked, kinda' optimistic, despite the circumstances.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—No. That's why I need to talk to you —I replied—. She hurt herself yesterday.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Oh, mate... I'm so sorry —he said, disappointed—. Honestly, the people who do that are quite immature.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—It usually depends on the case, but this time, I felt it was a manipulation.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—You're right —he said—. The fact of her doing in on the night you asked her for some time isn't a coincidence. But I can't believe she did something like that. I mean, shes's my friend too. I never imagined you could go that far.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Me neither. And I don't think our relationship will ever be what it was after this —and I couldn't be wrong—.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Look, in the last year of elementary school, I had a friend that did the same, for something stupid. I told her parents about. If you want to do the same, you have to know that she may not ever talk to you again, despite deep inside she will know that you did the best for her.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Okay. I think I have her mom's phone number. I'll text her anonymously until I'm sure that she won't tell Sea that I was the one who talked to her.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—I agree with that. Would wish you luck, but that's not the point —he concluded.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Thanks anyway —I said while we were back at the cafeteria.</p>

      <p>After that, I picked up my backpack, put my laptop inside it and then walked to the exit. But before a left, I went to where Sea was to say goodbye. However, instead of kissing her as I used to, I gave her a kiss on the forehead. It was the last love proof I gave her that afternoon, before sacrificing my feelings for her wellbeing.</p>
      
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;That kiss was a clear signal that everything was not okay, and I know that she probably noticed it —that was the idea, after all—. I left the cafeteria and went to the bus to go back home. I seated in the backseat and started texting to all of those who I considered friends back then (Roy, Rebecca, Tara, and Patrick) and told them what happened, asking for advice. Finally, I decided to text Sea's mom anonymously to avoid this from happening again.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;And that's what I did. My mother in law reacted way much better than I expected. She said that she would keep an eye on her, especially at night. She thanked me for warning her and having the emotional maturity to risk our relationship for her wellbeing. I said that it wasn't something I could be proud of, but I would do it again if necessary. She asked me to stay in contact and I said I would, but that I couldn't assure that I would keep the same relationship with Sea. And it was true. The Rift was clear and could not be undone. Not even as the years go by. Not even now, that I'm writing this, seated in the cafeteria where all this dramatic climax took place two years ago. Looking up the screen and remembering every detail as if it had happened just a second ago. But chill, not everything from now on will be dark and cold. Yes, there will be tough times for me and for you, dear reader —as long as you had tried to understand my position during this trip, which is something I'll always thank you, even if I don't know it—. But hey! It's okay, I know I haven't written our climax. I'm on it. Don't despair.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;After ending my conversation with Sea's mother, I switched chats and started texting the second part of my hapless plan. I decided to break up with Sea. It wasn't easy. Not even a bit. If we remember what happened in the previous pages, my biggest wish had been her falling in love with me. I wished it so bad that, when it finally happened, I thought she was just being condescending. It was something I reaffirmed after several months of relationship. Her exact words back then were:</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—After all, I wanted to give him a chance.</p>

      <p>I sent her the first text. I told her that I had spoken to her mom about what happened. Fuck it if she didn't want to talk to me ever again. She wasn't mad, but her disappointment was clear. She kept saying she was thankful, but that she doubted that they would pay attention to her because it wasn't the first time she had done something like that. When I read this, decided that it was time. I was sure that her mother will keep her safe, therefore my job was done. Then I started hesitating about what could happen depending on my choice. Would I be able to destroy our relationship because of a misunderstood conversation and a leak of trust? It was something that she had already done, which is why I understood that trying to save the insurmountable was nothing but a waste of strength. However, I started to remember all the good and beautiful things that we went through, stopping myself to think twice before taking that call.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I remember our time together, the anniversaries, the dates, the laughs, and the games. Our first kiss and the wave that followed it. My happiness of knowing that I was liked and the nervousness I felt when I wanted to ask her to date me.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I thought about everything that had happened until then, considering the pros and cons, and made my choice. I said that both of us had suffered a lot. I pointed out that, considering what had happened, our bond would never be what it used to be ever again. So, because of that, I thought it was the best for both of us not to continue with our relationship. And for someone who had to beg for it to happen, ending it was a tough thing to do to me.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;She didn't cry, nor beg nor ask me not to leave —she never was someone who begged, unlike me, who felt that was pedaling alone on a bicycle for two—. She just nodded and disconnected. The harm was done and trying to fix it seemed impossible for both of us. Therefore, I turned my phone off and went to bed.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;After going to my bed, I started to tremble. A wave of dark thoughts crossed my mind. Suddenly, I started to lose my breath. Breathing the hardest work to do. And the worst of it; I couldn't talk. Each try of doing so ended in a drowned sigh. Not even Adam, who was in that same room heard me. Luckily. It wouldn't be the last time something like that would happen to me. Not even close to being the last time.</p>
