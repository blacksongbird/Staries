      <p>Anxiety is serious shit. Nowadays, a lot of people suffer because of it, especially young people, increasing the number of teenagers that have it during the past few years a lot. This is stressful.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;However, it's important to identify between one single anxiety crisis and actually suffering it. They're different. Suffering anxiety in the clinic meaning of the word means that you suffer it in a chronicle, repetitive and periodic way. This is usually because of a trauma, or as a consequence of other illnesses. On the other side, an anxiety crisis can happen to anyone, even if you have never suffered one.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;However, the symptoms that come with anxiety depend on each individual, his or her conditions and the age in which is suffering them. And they're very unknown, too. Anxiety has the ability to provoke in those who suffer it an increase of heartbeat, sudden goosebumps, irrational thoughts, nightmares, hunger increase —and also it's opposite, the decrease of it—. Or at least that's what my counselor told me the next Monday. I didn't see him in a lot of time. Despite he swore he would never say a word about what we've talked, I just find it too hard to trust in a high school counselor. He told me to be very careful, because this could affect a lot my emotional stability, just as my social and academic performance. And he was right about it.</p>

      <br><br>

      <p>After an uncomfortable Monday of regular classes with a visit to our Psychology Department, this ended normally. The next day, as every Tuesday, I went with Roy to our IT workshop. When I got out of my home the next morning. I found my The Legend of Zelda's ring over my desk. I took it and, instead of wearing it like every day, I put it in my pocket and left. when I was at school, I found Patrick in the halls and gave him the ring.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—May I ask you a favor?</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Sure —he answered, confused.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Can you give this ring to Sea?</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Yeah.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Thanks —I said, with my head down—. And tell her to give it to the one she thinks that's the right one, no matter when or how.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Okay —he said after thinking about what I said.</p>

      <p>With it, I wanted to end our relationship completely, getting rid of the object that most remembered me of her. However, big was my surprise when, during the third break, she showed up in the IT building, looking for me. She said sorry with a weak voice that seemed almost like at the edge of crying. At the same time, she showed me her hand —while her arms were still covered by her sweater, clearly hiding what I was trying to forget—, holding the ring. She said she wanted me to have it because she didn't love anyone else.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the center of the place between a lot of people, all of them looking, shocked, I didn't know what to do. I started to consider my options carefully, without leaving any detail to luck. Finally, I decided to forgive her. After that, I took the ring and put it on my finger, knowing deep inside my heart that anything would be the same they once were. That love flame that once brightened with trust, would never shine as it once did, and those stars that collided against each other, after the supernova, would never shine again as they once did when they fell in love, surrounded by emptiness.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Almost a month passed without troubles. The Expo was close and Roy and I finally had our prototype armed and running. During that weekend, a lot of judges visited our project, and each of them liked it a lot and congratulated us for the work we did throughout the year. Mom, Dad, and Adam also came by, bringing me food and groceries despite eating was "not allowed".</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;At the end of the fair, I was hoping to see the close ceremony, which is a beautiful starred sky with fireworks. It is one of those "gold moments" that both life and school give us in exchange for our effort. However, Sea didn't answer, and we couldn't see it together. This made me sad, a lot, which is why I went back home without overthinking about it.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;On the next week, the final tests started. Nervousness, books, and calculators were at the top of the chain in school. However, a lot of us decided to take some time to go to the awards of the fair. Roy couldn't because he lives on the outside of The Nameless City, which is why he couldn't afford to stay in a non-obliged event. Sea and I decided to stay. After some awards for both science and technology, the first places of each level —eighth and ninth grade—, started. While the third place was announced, my heartbeat was increasing more and more, and my brain tried to convince itself that Roy and I wouldn't win anything, in order to avoid disappointment later. Second place. Nothing. Here, I strongly held Sea's hand —I always held it more than she used to hold mine, which was quite discouraging—, and I waited for the result. First place. The screen showed a picture all of a sudden. Immediately, my friends started to hug me without me having realized anything yet. Then I heard someone saying "Tyler Davidson and Roy Island" through the microphone.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I went out of the bleachers and went on stage, where the principal hugged me and put a medal around my neck. He immediately asked for the rest of the group, and I said that we were just two and the other guy couldn't make it. Therefore, they gave me Roy's medal and his price —which was a blue backpack with Intel's logo—, and sent me to take a picture for the record. There's nothing that hurt me the most that day than the fact that I couldn't go on stage with Roy, who deserved it as much as I did.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Then, the next week, the year ended with the grades delivering. Mom talked to me on the weekend to tell me about something she saw in Expo. While she was visiting other projects, she saw that Sea was hugging another guy in her classroom entrance, which happened just minutes before I showed up to give her a couple of earrings with the shape of angels, as a present for concluding her Expo. When she told me that, I talked to her about everything that happened weeks before and asked for advice. My biggest worry was thinking that I was seeing Seas attitude just because of jealousy. If that was the case, I was the one who was doing something wrong. But my mom told me that it didn't have anything to do with jealousy because, if it did, she wouldn't have seen it as something bad or weird. This argument hit me and left me thinking about it that whole week. Finally, during the last day of classes, I talked to Sea.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—We need to talk —I said without caring if it had a sour tone.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—What is it?</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Mom said she saw you hugging another guy in Expo, just before I gave you the earrings. Is it true? —I asked directly.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Well, I mean, I did hug Patrick, but you know that there's nothing between us. He's just my best friend —this one was a low blow. Months before The Rift Day, Sea used to say that I was both her best friend and her boyfriend. The fack of that changing hurt a lot—.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—But you promised me not to do it anymore, remember?</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—But since when I can't hug my friends? —she answered, pretty upset.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—You know I don't mean that.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Do I? Then what is it?</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—If my memory is still working, the last time we talked about this, happened what we both know that happened, and now you're just acting the same. And it is really weird hanging with your girlfriend while she is literally hanging on her best friends' necks, but it is even worse knowing that she does the same when she isn't with you. And trusting you in this cases it's just way too hard since what happened —I said.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Then you don't trust me anymore? —another stab straight my ego.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Right now, you're not giving me reasons to do so. And I'm running out of ways to tell you how uncomfortable this is to me.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—Listen to me, I'm not changing the way I am just because it is hard for you to trust me. You're supposed to love both my good and my bad things. And you can't ask me to change just because of that.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;—I'm not asking you to change your personality, I'm just talking about something that makes me feel uncomfortable in our relationship, and if you really loved me, you would try to make both of us happy, no matter what. But you're right, I can't ask you to change for me, but you can ask me to love you while I endure discomforts just for your desire neither. So... it is better to break up. For the good of both of us.</p>

      <p>She didn't say a word, just lowed her sight and left without saying nothing else. And for that stupidity, the outcome ended. The snowball grew and grew and ended crushing everything in its way. Even nowadays, with my anxiety, I still wonder what I could've done to fix them. A lot of times we asked that to ourselves. "What if I could turn back time...?". And this odyssey is the one that keeps people trapped in their pasts. This knot, that serpent, that memory. That melody you heard when everything was falling apart.</p>
