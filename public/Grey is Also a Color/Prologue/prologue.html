    <p>Have you ever felt like you’re alone in this world? Like your mind is a completely different universe, far away from others’ empathy? Let me tell you something. We all’ve felt like that at least once in our lives. No, you’re not going crazy nor about to relapse. Life is just a long highway with both nice and rough roads that you ride through, accompanied by both nice and rough souls —I have the feeling that I’ve used this metaphor before—. 
    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Oh, you don’t believe what I’m saying? It’s okay, I used to be the skeptic guy in the room most of the time too. But here’s when you and I become completely different worlds. I’ve understood this already, and I’m here yet to help you too. However, I won’t go easy on you. My best friend once told me that the best way to convince someone about something is through a story. A good one, of course. And I’m a storyteller by nature! Isn’t that great? 
    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;If you’re reading this by the time it’s being published, I’m sure quarantine has affected you at least a bit emotionally. We are social beings, and still we need to keep our social distance to preserve our health. It’s a terrible yet interesting situation. We hadn’t even thought about how important our social environment was until we lost it completely.
    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps you, who are reading this, already suffered from a mental condition like I do before quarantine. Whether it’s depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, HFA, and many others that I don’t have enough time to name here but are still as important as the ones above, quarantine could’ve meant the beginning of months full of panic attacks, chronical depression, stress and intrusive thoughts. 
    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The story I’m about to tell you is about someone who might have gone through something similar to what you are. The main objective of this book you’re now reading is to show you that —mostly now when we forget it the most—, despite the circumstances, you are not alone. You matter in this world, and losing you wouldn’t leave it just as it was before you arrived. You are important, even if your mind is telling you otherwise. You are loved, even when your thoughts are full of self-hatred and pain. What you still don’t get is that, no matter the reason, it’s always okay not to be okay.
    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;So, sit tight, go grab something to eat, play your favorite lo-fi music playlist, and get ready, because I’m about to tell you a story.
